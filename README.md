# Wordle : iOS Game

A simple and interactive Wordle game built with SwiftUI for iOS. The game lets users guess a 5-letter word within a limited number of attempts, and provides feedback on the correctness of each guess.

## Features
- **Word Guessing**: Players enter their guess for the target word.
- **Feedback**: Each guess is evaluated and provides visual feedback (correct letters in the right place and wrong ones).
- **Hints**: Players can reveal a character in the word.
- **Animations**: Win and lose animations using Lottie.
- **Play Again**: Option to restart the game after a win or loss.
- **Character Matching**: If particular character is matched, it will be shown on the screen.
